    "# Gauss Seidel\n",
    "\n",
    "Gauss Seidel is an iterative technique used for solving a system of linear equations. It is particularly favored for its simplicity and efficiency, especially in cases where the system is large and sparse. This method is an improvement over the Jacobi method, offering faster convergence under certain conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How It Works\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a system of linear equations represented in matrix form as $Ax = b$:\n",
    "\n",
    "- $A$ is a square matrix representing the coefficients of the system.\n",
    "- $x$ is the column vector representing the variables of the system.\n",
    "- $b$ is the column vector representing the right-hand side of the equations.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Gauss-Seidel method iterates over each equation in the system, solving for the variable in question and immediately using the updated values for subsequent calculations within the same iteration. This process is repeated until the solution converges to a sufficient degree of accuracy, determined by a pre-defined tolerance level.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Iteration Process\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initialization:** Start with an initial guess for $x$. If no better initial guess is available, a vector of zeros is commonly used.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Update Each Variable:** For each variable $x_i$ in the vector $x$, update its value based on the other variables' current values using the formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "   x_i^{(k+1)} = \\frac{1}{a_{ii}} \\left( b_i - \\sum_{j=1}^{i-1} a_{ij} x_j^{(k+1)} - \\sum_{j=i+1}^{n} a_{ij} x_j^{(k)} \\right)\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "\n",
    "   where $a_{ii}$ is the coefficient of $x_i$ in the matrix $A$, and $n$ is the number of variables in the system. The sums represent the contributions of all other variables to the $i$-th equation, with the first sum using the most recent values (indicative of Gauss-Seidel's immediate use of updated information).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Convergence Check:** After each full iteration over all variables, the convergence of the solution is checked. This can be done by comparing the norm of the difference between successive approximations of $x$ against a predetermined tolerance level.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Repeat:** If the solution has not converged, repeat step 2 with the updated values of $x$.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Advantages and Limitations\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Advantages:**\n",
    "  - **Efficiency:** It is more efficient than the Jacobi method, especially for large, sparse matrices.\n",
    "  - **Convergence:** Under certain conditions, such as when $A$ is diagonally dominant, the method is guaranteed to converge.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Limitations:**\n",
    "  - **Convergence Criteria:** The method does not always converge, especially if the matrix $A$ does not satisfy certain criteria like diagonal dominance.\n",
    "  - **Computational Complexity:** For dense matrices or systems where the condition for convergence is not easily met, the Gauss-Seidel method might not be the most efficient choice.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Gauss-Seidel method stands out for its direct approach to iterative solution refinement, making it a valuable tool in the numerical analyst's toolkit, especially for solving large systems where direct methods are impractical.\n",
